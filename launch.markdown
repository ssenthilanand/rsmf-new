**Goal of the Meeting with School Representatives:**

<p style="text-align:justify; text-justify: inter-word">This would be a meeting with representatives of the schools/homes for the poor from in and around Chennai, in which we will explain about RSMF background, purpose and goals, and seek from them inputs on the kind of support that they would like us to extend to them. There are broadly two types of engagements RSMF could have with them:<p>
<ul style="text-align:justify; text-justify: inter-word">
<li>Engaging with them in improving their ongoing teaching-learning processes within their schools – through providing additional coaching in the required subjects; extracurricular/ co-curricular/ creative activities; language, communication skills and personality development, etc.</li>
<li>Preparing and supporting the children for life beyond the school – opportunities for higher studies, careers, vocations, skills, employment etc that they can pursue after they pass out of the school. We would get the inputs from the school representatives on the kind of specific engagements they would like to have with the Foundation in these two areas. This input would form part of the basis for our future programs in this domain, as well as we will be able to identify institutions and individuals with whom we could be working , beyond our primary engagement with Avvai Home.</li>
