<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Our Work with Schools for Underprivileged Children</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify; text-justify: inter-word">The Foundation with its bi-line “Educate.Empower” has a sharp focus on supporting the  education of school children from underprivileged backgrounds. As we see it, interventions in schools with this objective can be broadly of two types:</p>
 - <p style="text-align:justify; text-justify: inter-word">Helping to improve the curricular, co-curricular and extra-curricular performance of children while they are in the  schools.</p>
 - <p style="text-align:justify; text-justify: inter-word">Enabling and assisting the children to take up careers, training or study programs of their choice, aptitude and abilities once they leave the school.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify; text-justify: inter-word">Most of the interventions in schools by voluntary agencies, corporate entities etc belong to the first type, with relatively less efforts devoted to the second type of support, though there are a number of vocational training institutions, charities that fund college education etc active in this space.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify; text-justify: inter-word">[<span style="text-decoration: underline">Click here</span>](../working/) for a detailed note on this subject where we have outlined a proposal for taking up the second type of intervention with schools in a systematic manner.</p>
 
<p style="text-align:justify; text-justify: inter-word">Below are  listed some activities that the Foundation has  pursued with some of the schools in the  Chennai region over time.Much of our efforts in this regard have been with the Avvai Home   and Girls' School in Adyar which is where Ms. Rajalakshmi had initiated an carried out her work during 2003-2013, and which our Foundation has attempted to take forward.</p>

<strong>Hostel Fees for College Students</strong>

Some students need financial support to stay in a suitable hostel during the time of their college studies. Our Foundation has been meeting the hostel fees of a few of the meritorious students from under privileged background for the past three years to enable them to complete their college education and become financially independent. It also provides counseling and career guidance to these students and mentor them.</p>
